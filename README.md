This repo contains a fresh [Symfony 4](https://symfony.com/) Flex installation with the bare minumum runtime requirements served by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). You can use it for classic PHP monolithical application development.

This is also a **DEVELOPMENT** version of [Caddy S4](https://github.com/ezmid/caddy-s4) containing php7-xdebug on top for code coverage and testing purposes.
