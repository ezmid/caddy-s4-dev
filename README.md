This repo contains a fresh [Symfony 4](https://symfony.com/) Flex installation with the bare minumum runtime requirements served by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). You can use it for classic PHP monolithical application development.

You can also use it for micro projects and APIs, although we recommend you try
our ezmid/rr-symfony image for those use cases. It contains the Road Runner
application server optimized for PSR-7 request/response communication.

This is a development version with xdebug enabled for codecoverage reporting.

## Requirements

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) >= 2.15
- [Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/) >= 17.12.0
- [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) >= 0.3 [optional]
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) >= 4.2 [optional]

**Currently Goss is not available for Windows. Build everything else works on all platforms.*
